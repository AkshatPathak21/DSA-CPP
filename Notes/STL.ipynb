    "Vector is a container which is dynamic in nature. Unlike arrays which when declared have a fixed size.When we declare a vector it creates an empty container.The push_back() function is used to push elements to the back of the container.There is another function called emplace_back(), similar to push_back(), which dynamically increases the size of the container and inserts the element to the back of the container. Generally emplace_back() is faster than push_back().emplace_back() automatically assumes the datatype of the input and inserts the element into the vector unlike push_back where we have to properly input the datatype of the input.\n",
